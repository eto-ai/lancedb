## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue on the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb).

## Opening a pull request

For the best chance of having your pull request accepted, please follow these guidelines:

1. Unit test all bug fixes and new features. Your code will not be merged if it doesn't have tests.
2. Use [conventional commit messages]() as pull request titles. Examples:
    * New feature: `feat: adding foo API`
    * Bug fix: `fix: issue with foo API`
    * Documentation change: `docs: adding foo API documentation`
3. If your pull request is a work in progress, leave the pull request as a draft.
   We will assume the pull request is ready for review when it is opened.
