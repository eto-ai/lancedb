//! # VectorDB ([LanceDB](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb)) -- Developer-friendly, serverless vector database for AI applications
//!
//! LanceDB is an open-source database for vector-search built with persistent storage,
//! which greatly simplifies retrevial, filtering and management of embeddings.
//!
//! The key features of LanceDB include:
//! - Production-scale vector search with no servers to manage.
//! - Store, query and filter vectors, metadata and multi-modal data (text, images, videos, point clouds, and more).
//! - Support for vector similarity search, full-text search and SQL.
//! - Native Rust, Python, Javascript/Typescript support.
//! - Zero-copy, automatic versioning, manage versions of your data without needing extra infrastructure.
//! - GPU support in building vector indices[^note].
//! - Ecosystem integrations with LangChain ü¶úÔ∏èüîó, LlamaIndex ü¶ô, Apache-Arrow, Pandas, Polars, DuckDB and more on the way.
//!
//! [^note]: Only in Python SDK.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! LanceDB runs in process, to use it in your Rust project, put the following in your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! [dependencies]
//! vectordb = "0.4"
//! arrow-schema = "50"
//! arrow-array = "50"
//! ```
//!
//! ### Quick Start
//!
//! ```rust
//! use vectordb::{Database, Table, WriteMode};
//! use arrow_schema::{Field, Schema};
//!
//! let db = Database::connect("data/sample-lancedb").await.unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! LanceDB uses [Apache Arrow] to define schema, data types and data itself.
//! It considers a [`FixedSizeList<float32>`](https://docs.rs/arrow/latest/arrow/array/struct.FixedSizeListArray.html)
//! columns as vectors.
